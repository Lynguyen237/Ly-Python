My journey to learn Python. 

Here you find a collection of challenges I've practiced in an effort to learn beginning Python 2. 

"0_PROJECT_" indicates the 2 major projects I worked on using various skills I've learned so far to (1) create a mini number guessing game and (2) create a fun story generator taking in user input to make a new story each time.

"PROB_" indicates files in which I solved problems and challenges applying a mix of concepts I learn.

"Practice_" indicates assignment files where I applied the new concepts I learned.

I try to record the problems as well as my different solutions and mistakes in comment to show how my thought process was in the learning process.
We learn best by recalling so try to not look at the solutions and make an attempt to solve the issue yourself first. 

As you learn, it's especially helpful if you ask a friend knowledgeable about coding to be your accountability partner and set up regular check-in with your buddy to keep pushing forward. Ideally, it's someone who is not hesitant to check in on you if you fail to share about your progress (or lack thereof) by the agreed time.

All the best and you can do it!
