# Ly-Python
My journey to learn python. 

Here you find a collections of problems I've practiced in an effort to learn basic Python 2. 
I try to record the problems as well as my different solutions and mistakes to remind myself of how my thought process was.
We learn best by recalling so try to not look at the solutions and make an attempt to solve the issue yourself first. 

It's especially helpful if you ask a friend knowledgeable about coding to be your accountability partner and set up regular check-in with your buddy to keep pushing forward. Ideally, it's someone who is not hesitant to check in on you if you fail to share about your progress (or lack thereof) by the promised time.

"Practice_" indicates assignment files where I applied the new concepts I learned.

"PROB_" indicates files in which I solve problems and challenges applying a mix of concepts I learn.

All the best,
Ly
