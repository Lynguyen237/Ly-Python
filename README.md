# Ly-Python
My journey to learn python. 

This is a collections of beginner problems I've practiced solving in an effort to learn Python 2. 
I leave the problem as well as various solutions I've attempted and made comment on my mistakes.
We learn best by recalling so try to not look at the solutions and make an attempt to solve the issue yourself first. 

It's especially helpful if you ask a friend knowledgeable about coding to be your accountability partner and set up regular check-in with your buddy to keep pushing forward.

All the best,
Ly
